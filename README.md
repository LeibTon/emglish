# Emglish - A New Vocabulary
### Just for Fun.

## What is it?
#### The vocabulary is made by changing or inserting 'm' into english words at appropriate position.

## Rules for new vocabulary:-

1. There should be only one editing.
2. No change in the first and last character.
3. Replace first "n" with  "m"
4. Replace "ll" with "ml".
5. If there is only one "l", add "m" after the first vowel before "l".


## Using the function:-

You just need to run the main.py using following command:

```python3 main.py```  
or  
```python main.py```  

depending on the version of python installed.
 
## Contributing Rules:

So, yeah you have fun with this new vocabulary. But certainly you aren't happy with certain words you get. So consider adding new rules.

#### How can you add?

1. Add new rule in "Rules for new vocabulary" and add the required code in main.py.
2. Afraid you can't code. No problem. Just add the rule in "Rules for new vocabulary" and add [new rule] after your new rule and we will write the code for you.

##### Let's Enjoy.
##### Thank You.
